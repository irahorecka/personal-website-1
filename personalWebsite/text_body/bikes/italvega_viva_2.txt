The 1971 Italvega Viva Sport was an entry-level road bike assembled in Torpado, Italy. Italvega later transitioned to Univega after 1976.

I bought the bike in summer 2011. I do not remember the condition of the bike when I purchased it. But I do believe it had mostly original components.

I bought new cables, cable housing, and tires. I did the usual clean up, lubrication, and polishing of the chrome components. The bar tape was original, and I was impressed by its shape and quality.

I admired the brown color of the bicycle. The frame size was perfect. I sold the bike three months after purchasing.
