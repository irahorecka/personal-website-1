The bike is equipped with a Suntour Sturmey Archer-like 3-speed internal hub. There is an index shifter that operates by shifting while pedaling backwards.

I bought the bike for $40 in May 2020 for a quick restoration project. The bike was in great condition, needing only a quick clean and lubrication of moving parts. The bike is very smooth and enjoyable to ride.

The bike was sold for $180.
