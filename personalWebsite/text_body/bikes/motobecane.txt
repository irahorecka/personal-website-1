The Motobecane Jubilee Sport was a mid-level racing/road bicycle from the '80s. The frame was constructed using Columbus CrMo steel tubing.

I bought the bike in spring 2014 from a gentleman in San Jose. The bike came equipped with primarily Japanese components, such as Suntour derailleurs and cranks. The bike was equipped with French wheels and Weinman brakes.

Overall, this bike was a robust. However, the frame was too large for me, so I sold it to my roommate at the time for $280.

I added new bar tape and cables. I was considering changing out the cable housing, but I admired the navy blue color of the original housing. Also, checkout the unbutted chrome fork!

The suede, beige Turbo saddle was a nice touch.
