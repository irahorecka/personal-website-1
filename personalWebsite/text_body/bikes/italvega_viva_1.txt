The 1973 Italvega Viva Sport was an entry-level road bike assembled in Torpado, Italy. Italvega later transitioned to Univega after 1976.

The bicycle was in fair condition when I purchased it. Unfortunately, I do not remember how much I bought it for. The low-mid level framesets have the inverted triangle Columbus foil decal, while the better models have the rectangle Columbus foil decal.

The chrome lugs were a nice touch to this bike. I believe the bike had a hodgepodge of mixed components. I purchased the leather Masi seat from a local bike store for $40 and added a matching leather bar tape. I rode this bike in college and sold it after a year of ownership for ~$200.

I did enjoy the Campagnolo Gran Turismo rear derailleur, which I believe was a lower end model of Campagnolo bike components.
