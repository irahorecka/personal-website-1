The Raleigh International was the second from the top of Raleigh's production bike line, below the Professional. Like the Professional, it the frame was all Reynolds 531, double butted, and it came with a full Campagnolo Nuovo Record group--except for the brakes, which were Weinmann centerpulls.

I bought this bicycle in fall 2015 in Santa Cruz for $90. The bicycle was in poor shape when I purchased it, with failing tires and heavily pitted frame. The bicycle came as a bicycle, as opposed to a partially assembled frame.

I knew the value in the Raleigh International and jumped on the listing as soon as I saw it on Craigslist. Though I could not discern with certainty the bike was a Raleigh International, the chrome Nervex lugs gave away its identity.

I spent a month polishing the frame to bring out its vibrant green color and chrome lugs. The heron headbadge is a beautiful Raleigh logo that was discontinued in the early 1970s.

I eventually sold the frame for $250 to a gentleman on craigslist. He seemed to be a collector of Raleigh Internationals. I am glad the frame went to someone who appreciates the value and history of these bikes.
