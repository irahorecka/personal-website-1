The Bianchi Stelvio was considered a high-quality mid-range road bicycle. The tubeset is Columbus Aelle R. The only Campagnolo parts are the derailleurs and they are lower mid-range Triomphe. The rest is a mix of second-tier itlain suppliers, such as Ofmega and Modolo. On top of all that it's red, which is first choice for some other Italian products but not a Bianchi. Original price was $420.

I got the bike as a run down single-speed conversion. I bought it in mid 2014 from a gentleman at the Fruitvale BART station. The deal was as follows: I would trade my 1970s Campagnolo Super Record rear and front derailleur along with $50 for the bicycle. I was dissappointed in the condition of the bicycle when I saw it; it was in really crappy shape. I negotiated the cash offer down to $25.

This bike turned out to be one of the best bikes I had the pleasure of restoring and riding. Due to its single speed nature, the bike was a no-brainer to repair and maintain. The lack of gear shifters made the bike all the more fun to ride. No rubbing of chain on the front derailleur cage, no poor shifting in the rear, etc.

I gifted the bike to my brother, Gene, for christmas in 2015. He was happy with the bike and rode it around at UCSD while he finished his undergraduate education.

He gave me the bicycle after he graduated. I did a minor tune-up and sold it on craigslist for $120 in spring of 2019.
