The Schwinn Super Sport is a superb, American-made bicycle from the '60s to the '80s. The original bicycles were known to be the upper echelon of bicycles at the time of manufacture.
The Super Sport was known for its fillet-brazing. Fillet-brazing is an alternative method of constructing high-quality lightweight bicycle frames without the use of lugs.

The value of the super sports are in their frames. The frames are fillet-brazed cro-molly like some of the higher models. The components on super sports are mostly steel and fairly heavy (but bomb proof).

I bought this bike in summer 2018 from a college graduate in Livermore for $160. The bike was in dirty, but overall good condition (it even came with original Schwinn generator lights!) I did the usual clean and tune-up and rode it for about 6 months before selling it on Craigslist for $250.
