This Bertin C34 was the second vintage bike I refurbished. Bertin C34 was a 1970s French era bicycle known for its high quality touring bicycles. The C34 had a full Vitus Durifort frame with Simplex derailleurs and Mafac Racers centerpull brakes.

I purchased this bike in Winter 2010 for $150 from a guy on Craigslist. The bike was in decent condition, but was not rideable. After a good degreasing and tune-up, the bike was ready to roll.

A feature I found unique about this bike was its mustache handlebars. I have never seen anything like it. At first, I wanted to swap this handlebar for the standard drop bars, but due to the handlebar diameter being unique (note, it is a French bicycle), I decided to keep the mustache bars.

This bike was a blast to refurbish. I rode it around for two months before I sold it on Craigslist.

The gentleman I sold it to was so stoked about the bike that he sent me a follow-up email acclaiming the bicycle and how it garnered compliments from his friends. I believe the selling price was $350.
