The Italvega Nuovo Sport was the second tier road bike of the Italvega fleet, surpassing the Italvega Viva Sport.

Sometimes, your bike project are a big headache. This was one of those projects. At the time, I was so obsessed with Italian bicycles with any Campagnolo components. As soon as I saw this bike on Craigslist for $200, I pounced on the sale. This was in the summer of 2011, while I was still in high school. At the time, $200 was a lot of money!

The bike was in tragic condition when I purchased it, and I was ashamed to have spent a large sum of money on this piece of junk. Nevertheless, the bicycle had nice aeshtetics. For example, if you look at the lugs binding the frame tubes together, you will notice a gold trim that was likely painted by hand.

I did not put in any work into this bikand sold it as-is to a gentleman from UC Berkeley. I believe I sold it for $190. In the end, I felt remorseful selling a bike in such poor condition.

This was one of those eye-opening lessons where a bike enthusiast should not blindly purchase a bike just because of its fancy components.
