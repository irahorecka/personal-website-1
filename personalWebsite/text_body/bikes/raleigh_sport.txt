For many years, in many parts of the world, the Raleigh "Sports" three-speed bicycle was considered the ultimate in human-powered transportation. These bicycles were not toys, and, despite the model name, they were not sporting equipment...they were serious vehicles. The men and women who built them, by and large, also rode them, as their primary means of transportation.

Most modern bicycles are designed with the primary intent to catch your eye on the sales floor, and persuade you to buy. That is not what a Raleigh Sports was about...these were designed to provide solid, dependable transportation for the British public, at a time when only the upper classes had motorcars. These bikes were built to last 100 years, with reasonable care.

I bought this bicycle from my neighbor as he was pushing it out of his backyard. He stated that this was a gift for his wife, but she never rode it. He sold it to me on the spot for $40.

The bike was in poor riding condition when I purchased it. I took minor care of it, lubing the chain and brakes. Eventually, the bike was rideable and surprisingly smooth. As Sheldon Brown mentioned, these bikes were meant to last 100 years, granted they were given standard care.

Due to my inclination for road bikes over 3-speed bicycles, I sold the bike to a nice couple 6 months later for $120.
