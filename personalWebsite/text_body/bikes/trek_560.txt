The Trek 560 Pro Series was an exceptional bike during its time. It came with Reynolds 531 tubing and was build in Waterford Wisconsin.

Some interesting details of this bike is the cable "tunnel" in the chain stay to allow the rear derailleur cable to pass. This was Trek's cream of the crop bicycle during its time.

I bought this bicycle in June 2019 for $160. Basic maintenance issues were present, such as bad tires, worn out bar tape and cables, etc. As usual, I stripped down the frame of its parts and cleaned and degreased everything from the bottom up. Some interesting features of this bike is its red brake cable housing, yellow seat covers, and its matching yellow handlebar tape.
I sold this bike on April 20 for $420.
