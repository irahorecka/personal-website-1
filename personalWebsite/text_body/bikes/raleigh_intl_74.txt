As mentioned in the 1971 Raleigh International post, the Raleigh International was the second from the top of Raleigh's production bike line, below the Professional. Like the Professional, it the frame was all Reynolds 531, double butted, and it came with a full Campagnolo Nuovo Record group.

This was my first experience working with a Raleigh International. I bought this bike in Spring 2015 from an old gentleman in Santa Cruz. I negotiated the price to $190 and he was kind enough to deliver it to my house.

As history claims, the bicycle came with all Campagnolo Nuovo Record groupset (the whole 9 yards). This was a famously acclaimed bike and I was very excited to get my hands on it. Unfortunately, the frame came with grey bondo on the top tube, marring its beautiful champagne color.

Due to the rims being tubular rims, rather than your run-of-the-mill clinchers, I decided to disassemble the bike and isolate the individual components.

I parted the components on eBay and sold the frame to a collector on Craigslist. Overall, I made a nice sum of money this way. I will always remember the beautifully designed Campagnolo Nuovo Record rear derailleur and crankset.
