This Ritchey Logic road bike was assembled in 1995 in the United States. The frame is build with welded Tange Prestige steel specially made for Tom Ritchey.

This road bike was an exceptional road bike during its time. The bike came equipped with full Shimano 105 groupset in pristine condition.

I bought this bike in October 2017 from a local thrift store for $200. I cleaned the bicycle from the bottom up and put about $60 of parts into this project (bar tape, chain, cables).

I sold the bike later next year for $560. The customer was excited to get his hand on a high-quality road bike.
