The Tiger Super Model Deluxe was a Japanese import bicycle during the '60s. The bicycle is throughly Japanese. The wheels are steel araya 27x1-1/4, the brake set is centerpull Shimano Tourney with Shimano brake levers. Front derailleur is Shimano Thunderbird. Rear Derailleur is Shimano Skylark. Levers are also Shimano branded. It is not clear what brand the Crank is but there is a Japan mark on both crank arms.

The bicycle was in fairly poor shape when I bought it in spring 2011. I was still a novice at bicycle refurbishing at the time, so I went the extra mile to polish and lube every component.

I added new cables, housing, and gumwall tires. I believe the bike was a lower-end model purchased from a department store, being made of standard steel (exact composition unknown).

I rode it for about a month before selling it on Craigslist. I believe I sold it for $250. Regardless, the bicycle had charm in its design and was in excellent condition considering its age.
