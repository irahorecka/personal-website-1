This is a project that focuses on mining Craiglist Housing posts, globally.

The script used the multiprocessing library to leverage multiple cores to download Craigslist Housing posts in parallel. The results include title, price, location, and date posted, to name a few.
If specified, geotags (latitude, longitude) of every post can be included. This project would be useful if machine learning housing patterns is of interest.
