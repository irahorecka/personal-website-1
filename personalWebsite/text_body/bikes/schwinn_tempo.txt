The 1987 Schwinn Tempo was an upper-end road bicycle from the Schwinn bicycle company.

The 1987 model featured Shimano's new 105 low profile Biopace crankset, aero pedals with unbreakable resin toe clips and braided nylon straps.

The Tempo also featured Columbus Tenax tubing for its main frame. Unlike the Schwinn Prelude, which had many similar features to the Tempo, the Tempo had cromoly forks. The Schwinn Tempo weighed an approximate 22 lbs.

I had the joy of refurbishing an '87 Tempo. The bike was bought from a gentleman's garage in Fremont. He had many bikes and wanted to clear up some space.

The maintenance was simple: new chain, cables, and housing. The bartape was kept original due to its minimal wear and fantastic coloring. I eventually sold the bike for $280.
