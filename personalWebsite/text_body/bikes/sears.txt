This is an all-original Sears / Roebuck Co. Free Spirit road bike. The bike has a 10-speed transmission with primarily Japanese components. The bike is beige in color with white cable housing.

I bought the bike in spring 2020 for $55 from a gentleman who listed it on OfferUp for $85.

I decided that I will not put work into this bike, except minor adjustments to the brake levers, etc. The bike is in fairly good shape considering its age.

The bike is currently listed on craigslist for $140.
