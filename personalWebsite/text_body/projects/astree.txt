This project combines the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/ast.html" target="_blank">ast</a> module with <a href="https://github.com/pydot/pydot-ng" target="_blank">pydot_ng</a> to draw abstract syntax trees specified in DOT language scripts. An abstract syntax tree is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language (e.g. Python).
