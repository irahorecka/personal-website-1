This is an all-original Schwinn Traveler from 1986. I bought this bike for $30 on Facebook Marketplace.

The bike was in rough shape when I bought it, with the front tire flat and the rear leaking air. By all-original, I mean that the bike was not touched and stored in a shed for nearly 30 years.

This bike was an entry-level bike at the time. The frame was assembled in Taiwan with most of its components sourced from Japan.

In the end, I decided not to put in too much work into this bike. I sold it to a collector for $70.
