The Tiger Super Model Deluxe was a Japanese import bicycle during the '60s. The bicycle is throughly Japanese. The wheels are steel araya 27x1-1/4, the brake set is centerpull Shimano Tourney with Shimano brake levers. Front derailleur is Shimano Thunderbird. Rear Derailleur is Shimano Skylark. Levers are also Shimano branded. It is not clear what brand the Crank is but there is a Japan mark on both Crank arms.

The bicycle was in fairly poor shape when I bought it in mid 2011. I was still new to bicycle refurbishing at the time, so I went the extra mile to make sure all components were spick and span.

I finally sold this bike on Craigslist. I believe the selling price was $250, but I am unsure. Regardless, the bicycle had charm in its design and a lot of weight in its frame.
