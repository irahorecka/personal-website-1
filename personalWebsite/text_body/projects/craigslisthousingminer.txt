This is a project that is focused on mining up to every Craiglist Housing post from around the world.

The script uses the concurrent.futures module to download Craigslist Housing posts in parallel. The results include title, price, location, and date posted, to name a few.
If specified, geotags (latitude, longitude) of every post can be included. This project would be useful for training a machine learning model on housing price relative to location or season.
