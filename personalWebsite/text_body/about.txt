I like to refurbish vintage bicycles and I like to code. I strive for excellence in my work and I seek meaningful interactions.
I graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a BS in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I have three years of biotechnology experience with nearly two years of programming experience.
I am self-taught in R, Python, and web programming (HTML5, CSS, JS).
On top of this, I enjoy working on random hobbies and bicycles! Please reach out to me if you have any bicycle-related questions or would like suggestions on your next bike purchase!
