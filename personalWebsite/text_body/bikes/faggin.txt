The Faggin Campione del Mondo was a top-of-the-line italian racing bicycle that was on par in quality with other acclaimed Italian brands, such as Colnago, Olmo, etc.
Faggin (pronounced “Fazjin”) was founded by former cyclist Marcello Faggin in 1945, the brand is known in Italy as a producer of the finest quality bicycles. In 1984 the company equipped the Italian cycling pursuit team at the Los Angeles Olympics.
I bought the Frame with mismatched Mavic rims, Dura Ace crankset, and Dura Ace SIS index shifters for $200 in the summer of 2013. I bought a full Shimano 600 SIS group (front and rear derailleurs, front and rear caliper brakes, brake levers). I restored the bike in Fall 2013 and rode it for about a year before selling it. The bicycle was a lovely ride, but the frame was a tad too tall for me (60 cm).
I don't remember the selling price, but I do remember this bike being my first experience working with and riding a highly regarded vintage Italian bicycle.
