The Raleigh Grand Prix Racing USA was a mid-tier performance road bike in the mid 1980s. the bike was equipped with a 6-speed cluster in the rear with a 2-speed crankset. The frame was built using Reynolds 555sl Cromoly tubes. The bike came with predominately Japanese components, such as the Suntour ARX front and rear derailluer, and Weinmann anodized aluminum alloy wheelset.

I bought the Raleigh in summer 2011 as a project. At the time, anything chrome was very attractive. The grand labeling around the top tube, down tube, and seat tube was fantastic and very flashy.

While I was fixing this bike, I realized the chrome components were not actually chrome, but of a softer alloy. I was terribly bummed to find out that it scratched even with brass wool (a soft metal useful for scrubbing off rust.)

The bike was fairly simple to fix, and I rode it around for a month or two. Eventually, I realized the frame was too tall for me (60 cm), and I sold it shortly after.

To this day, I appreciate the white-walled tires and the variegated bar tape.
