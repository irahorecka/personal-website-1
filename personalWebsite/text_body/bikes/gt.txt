Okay so this is the 2001 GT Attack. It's a pretty sleek bike, wouldn't you agree?
So here is the bike all dismantled and what not. It's time for a cleaning.

Finally, here is the bike a little bit more cleaned up. Doesn't that feel so much better?

The bicycle prior to assembling its components.

All components and were assembled in mid-May, with new bar tape, brake and shifter cable/housing, and Shimano HG chain. The Alexrims wheels, with new Panaracer tires, were swapped with my brown Specialized Allez. My main bike (the Allez) needed new wheels and tires, anyway.

The bike was a pleasure to ride; very fast, smooth, and dependable. But I only really need one road bike, and I am not ready to part with my Allez, so I posted this bike on Craigslist.

I posted the bike for $380 and sold it the same day for $340.
