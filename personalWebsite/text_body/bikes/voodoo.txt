As Bike Magic (an online blog) states, "The frame is a tight-sloping top-tube package from Joe Murray – the same designer who brought us the original Konas – with own-brand butted cro-mo tubing. The seat tube is extended, the headtube ring reinforced and the seatstays ‘snaked’, and all the detail is neat and clean, right down to drilled canti bosses that act as cable guides for the rear gear. No gussets, no CNC sections, no disc mounts, just classic steel construction."

I bought this bike in fall 2016 from a gentleman in San Jose for $110 (Craigslist ad image above). It was in decent condition to begin with, only needing a proper cleaning and lubrication moving parts to get it running smoothly. I rode the bike to and from work in 2016 and 2017, but unfortunately, it was stolen in summer 2017.
