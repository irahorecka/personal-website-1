This Schwinn Breeze was manufactured at the Schwinn Factory in Chicago, February 1967.

The bike is equipped with a Bendix 2-speeautomatic rear hub. One can shift gears by lightly pedaling backwards.

Notice there are no brake levers and calipers. This bike comes with coaster brakes, where one pedals backwards to stop the bike.

I bought this bike from a gentleman in Morgan Hill, CA for $60. The bike was in decent condition, only needing a light cleaning, polishing of surface rust, and lubrication of moving parts.

I sold the bike a week later for $120.
