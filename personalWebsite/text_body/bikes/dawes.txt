Known as the affordable tourer in the 1970s, the Dawes Galaxy was a nicely regarded road bicycle with unbutted Reynolds 531 tubing.

I bought this bike from a gentleman at Fruitvale BART station in summer 2011. The bike came with a potpourri of various components. One of these components that I did not appreciate at the time was a vintage (if not the first generation) Dura Ace Biopace crankset.

I spent about three months fixing this bike, replacing the old cable housing with white housing, adding a used Brooks saddle, wrapping a new, tan bartape.

This was one of my favorite bikes that I have owned. I had it for about a year before I sold it for ~$200 on craigslist. The gentleman who bought it was particularly drawn to the headbadge.

Moreover, I bought a Brooks saddle to go with this bike! $50 from Craigslist.
