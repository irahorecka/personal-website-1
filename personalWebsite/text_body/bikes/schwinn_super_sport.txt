The Schwinn Super Sport is a superb, American-made bicycle from the '60s to the '80s. The original bicycles were known to be the upper echelon of bicycles at the time of manufacture.
The Schwinn Super Sport that I have was assembled in 1972. This bicycle is known for its filet brazing.

Did I mention just how cool this bike is? This bike was heavy as hell when I first bought this thing.
