This is a Jupyter notebook repository for plotting real-time AC Transit bus coordinates on a map.
The map uses the <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/python-actransit/">python-actransit</a> library along with Bokeh to gather still images of live bus coordinates and make a stop-motion gif of these accumulated images.

I wrote the Python API wrapper for AC Transit, allowing me to gather live coordinates of buses within the Oakland/Berkeley region using Python. When I posted this gif to reddit, the Oakland community had a thrill looking at and criticizing the bus movements. In particular, one user mentioned there was an idle bus at the Fruitvale BART station that didn't move during the hour-long duration of this gif.
This map is focused on the Oakland and Berkeley region. AC Transit extends in all directions beyond this scope, and if one would like to visualize these regions, they can jump into this repository on my GitHub and adjust the mercator coordiates to their liking.
