This Berma Professional is a true hand-crafted bicycle from the Italian tradition. It has been manufactured by the Bertocco brothers which run the family business until the 1990s. The frame shows lots of engraved parts and a refined attention to details - as the lugs, the stem, the fork crown, the bottom bracket shell and the rear brake bridge.

I purchased this frame in late 2015 with hopes of building the ultimate Italian bicycle. I had excellent components salvaged from my 1974 Raleigh International, which I purchased in the summer of 2015, that I planned to use for this bike.

In the end, I built the bicycle without these components; deviating from the original idea of building a 10-speed to building a single-speed bicycle.

The ride was excellent with great response from the frame when going over driveways or going around curves. Due to the expensive and collector's nature of the bicycle, I felt that I did not had the complete freedom to ride it however I liked.

I stripped the frame of its components and sold the frame for $160 on Craigslist.
