The Mondial Campione was my first vintage bicycle. To this day, I am baffled by its history. It was an Italian 4 speed bicycle (four gears in the back, one in the front) with components of unknown Italian origin.
It was a very pretty bicycle, and I bought it for $120 from a gentleman in San Jose in the summer of 2010. I bought new cable housing, bar tape, and tires. The bike rode just fine and I had it for about 6 months before I sold it for $250 on Craigslist.
I would love to see this bicycle in person again!
